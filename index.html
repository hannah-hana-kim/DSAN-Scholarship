      <h1>Analysis of Natural Bridges National Park</h1>
      <p>
        Introduction: <br>
        This website is created to analyze the data at Natural Bridges National Park. The analysis includes the vegetation area, plant litter, volumetric water content, and summer indicators data. For the sake of flow, I focused only on the summer data.
        <br><br>
        The baseline data is the environment data at Natural Bridges National Park collected from 1980 to 2018, and the organization predicted the same features from 2021 to 2024 using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
        <br>
        Since this analysis includes both collected and predicted data, it will help us understand the climate change at Natural Bridges National Park and predict the future climate change.

        <p>
          I wanted to look at the vegetation area at Natural Bridge National Park first. 
          <br><br>
          Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.3 show the vegetation area at Natural Bridge National Part in 1980, 2018, and 2024 respectively. Although they showed a slight difference, the greenery area in the northeast part of the park had been increased, and the mid-part and southern part had decreased in Figure 1.2.<br><br>
          
          Based on the data from 1980 to 2018, the organization predicted the same data from 2021 to 2024 and the figure 1.3 shows the greenery area in 2024. Although the predicted data doesn't show a significant difference from the historical data, it seems that the greenery area has been recovered in the northeast part of the park.

      <div class="sub_section_bottom">
        <p>
          After analyzing the greenery area, I also wanted to deep dive into plant litter variable. This scatter plot shows the relationship between the percentage area of the plant litter and the annual temperature. <br>

          According to the <cite id="cite_color">
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-018-3889-x">article: Litter decomposition, effects of temperature driven by soil moisture and vegetation type</a></cite>, the plant litter has both direct and indirect relationship with temperature. 

          The article tells us that the temperature will likely to decrease when there are more plant litter. This line chart proves this information. This chart included both historical data and predicted data, and it also predicted that the temperature will decrease in 2024.

        <h4>Volumetric Water Content by Season</h4>
        <p>
          After deep-diving into the vegetation of the area, I wanted to check out the volumetric water content of the area. This bar chart shows the volumetric water content by season. <br>
          The volumetric water content(VWC) is the amount of water in a given volume of soil. <br>
          Assuming that the evaporation rate is high in the summer, the VWC value was the lowest in the summer and the highest in the water as shown in the plot. <br>
          
          Interestingly, I initially thought that the VWC would be lower in the predicted data, both on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, but the data shows that the VWC will be higher that the past. This also aligns with the first three map plots, where the vegetation area will be increased (in some parts).

        <p>
          After taking a look at the volumetric water content value, I wanted to deep-dive into the summer data. The data gives some indicators of the summer such as number of days of dry soil, evaporation rate, precipitation rate, etc. <br>
          In this graph, I focused on the trend of the three indicators: Number of days of dry soil, Evaporation rate, Precipitation rate. The data has been normalized since the unit of the indicators were different. From this graph, we can see that the evaporation and precipitation trend were similar, whereas the number of days of dry soil was the opposite. <br>
          From this graph, we can learn that the more days of dry soil, the less the evaporation rate and precipitation rate.

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sub_section_right">
        Now, I wanted to zoom out a little bit, and see the relationships among the five indicators in the summer. This graph also includes the predicted data from 2021 and 2024. <br>
        Overall, I could see a relationship between the evaporation rate and the volumetric water content value. The higher the evaporation rate, the lower the VWC value. Also, there was a relationship found between the number of days with dry soil and the precipitation rate. The higher the precipitation rate, the less the number of days with dry soil.
        <br>
        Interestingly, the predicted data from 2021 to 2024 did not reflect this analysis that well. Throughout 4 years, it was difficult to figure out the relationships that we found from the historical data. </div>

        <h4>Data Prediction</h4>
        <p>
          I wondered if we can predict the data based on the previous analysis. I wanted to see how better or worse will the climate will change. Unfortunately, the vegetation data and the summer indicators barely had any correlation with RCP. <br>
          This can explain why the predicted data from 2021 to 2024 did not reflect the historical data that well. <br>

        This analysis shows the environment data at Natural Bridges National Park. I tried to analyze the historical data which is from 1980 to 2020 and the predicted data from 2021 to 2024. <br>
        Interestingly, the predicted data did not reflect the historical data that well, and also showed the climate will get better in general. <br>
